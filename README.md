### Other
* Why do you want to join us?
  * Because I want to work on long standing products which have achieved excellent product-market fit and are used by 100s of millions of users and everyone loves using them
  * I want to increase the impact of my work

* Most challenging task/project done so far?
  * Here you can give the example of the speedometer type component you made for Bournvita project
  * Say that no one was able to make it, they tried d3.js, chart.js, JQuery and even Vanilla Js but could not figure it out
  * My manager said that we are heavily relying on you to do this and waiting for a solution from your side
  * I went above and beyond and made the exact component with its implementation and I was praised for my work by senior SDs and my manager
  * I felt like I saved the day!
* Did you have confrontation with manager/colleague/lead?
  * Say that it has never been a confrontation as such but more of a team discussion about the progress of the project and any blockers
  * But I have received some feedback such as - Abhinav this screen that you have made, the button size is not according to Figma, seems a little smaller, can you fix this? And I fixed it immediately.
  * You could mention how you gave your colleague feedback once about using custom events instead of polling for the variable continuously using setInterval. He said that changing the code so close to production will be detrimental, so we made a mutual decision to make the changes in the next release cycle.
* Was there a time of disagreement when you were right?
  * I always do a discussion rather than a confrontation whenever there is difference of opinion
  * I always try to listen to the other side fully and even change my idea if I think the side is reasonable
  * I never stick to a fixed thought or force my beliefs on anyone
  * There was once this time where I suggested my colleague to use a custom event dispatch rather than using setInterval to check the status of a variable for an async operaton, we mutually decided that the improvement was valid but due to time constraints, we will do it in the next release cycle, otherwise, if something goes wrong, we might risk this release and that is what we ended upo doing as a team
 * Was there a time of disagreement when you were wrong?
   * I always think thoroughly before making a statement
   * And if someone gives me feedback or suggests me something, I always listen carefully and implement the changes
   * I have never disagreed as such but more like discussed
   * It happened once that we had to make live a limited version of our app with a coming soon page much before the full release
   * The develop branch had this coming soon page which was having some information and gifs and several components inside it
   * I created a new branch from the current master and tried to incorporate this page from develop but I had a lot of errors and had to do a lot of copy pasting of various components, global variables etc.
   * I thought it was better to clone develop and remove what was not needed, work my way backwards
   * My senior colleague had a call with me and told me that what I have done is not a good strategy and we discussed about it
   * He said that this will create issues later when some changes might have to be made to the coming soon page and might lead to some deployment issues which I was not aware of
   * I accepted my mistake and my oversight and I asked him that I will create the branch from master only and add the components to that branch
   * I did that and he was satisfied
 * Did you ever have to deliver in a tight deadline and how did you manage?
   * You can talk about nutricheck and how you raised your concern about the timeline being too short
   * But the project had to be done in that time, otherwise the whole project could be at risk
   * I decided to start with a template our company had already made and asked prioritised the most critical features first
   * I focused on the most critical parts of the UI and created the basic layout first and the basic functionality first such as global state and FPD form
   * I did not over-generalise components, I tried not to get lost in the detail and slowly added more and more features
   * I focused on completing the prime functionality first and not focus on excessive optimization in the beginning (like optimization of assets) which could be done at the end
   * I was able to deliver the project within the deadline and resolved the bugs created by the QA team
